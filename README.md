# Accelometer-with-I2C-crystal-display
The accelerometer measures the acceleration forces acting on the device in three dimensions (X, Y, Z). These measurements can be accessed via an Arduino microcontroller using the I2C communication protocol. The I2C display provides a user-friendly interface for viewing the accelerometer data in real-time.
